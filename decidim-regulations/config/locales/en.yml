        <p>During the rule creation process, there are two moments in which you can participate:</p>
        <pIn <strong>public consultations</strong>: the Government, before starting to prepare the norm, consults the citizens about the opportunity and the most relevant aspects to regulate the matter in question.</p>
        <p>In this initial phase, you can assess the need to regulate a subject and make contributions on what aspects must be taken into account when doing so.</p>
        <p>Once there is a <strong>draft regulation</strong>: when the Government has already drafted a first text, it opens it to the public to improve the wording and content.</p>
        <p>In this part of the process, you can make contributions and comments on the draft standard before its final approval.</p>
